## Working with Images

### Uploading Images

**Method 1: Drag & Drop**

2. Drop into the image field
3. It uploads automatically

**Method 2: Click to Upload**
1. Click the image field
2. Browse your computer
3. Select image
4. Click Open

### Image Best Practices

**File Formats:**
- ✅ JPG for photos
- ✅ PNG for graphics with transparency
- ✅ SVG for logos (if available)
- ❌ Avoid: BMP, TIFF

**File Sizes:**
- Aim for < 500KB
- Large images slow down the website
- Use [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com) to compress before uploading

**Dimensions:**
- Featured images: 1200x630px (works for social media)
- Gallery images: 1920x1080px
- Team photos: 800x800px (square)
- Logos: Any size (they'll be resized)

**Alt Text** (Always required!)
- Describes the image for:
  - Screen readers (accessibility)
  - SEO (search engines)
  - If image doesn't load
- Good: "Team members collaborating around a whiteboard with sticky notes"
- Bad: "Image 1", "Photo", "IMG_1234"

### Focal Point / Hotspot

When you upload an image, you'll see a circle you can drag:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         🖼️ Image            │
│                              │
│      [  Important  ]  🔵     │
│      [   Part      ]         │
│                              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- Images are cropped differently on mobile vs desktop
- The focal point ensures the important part is always visible
- Example: If you have a person in the photo, center the focal point on their face

**How to set it:**
1. Click the image after uploading
2. Drag the blue circle to the most important part
3. Save

## Tips & Best Practices

### Content Creation Tips

**✍️ Writing:**
- Write in short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Use headings to break up content
- Use bullet points for lists
- Write in active voice: "We designed..." not "It was designed..."
- Read aloud—if you stumble, readers will too

**🎨 Visual Content:**
- Every piece of content should have at least one image
- Use high-quality, relevant images
- Avoid stock photos that feel generic
- Show real people, real work, real impact

**♿ Accessibility:**
- Always write alt text for images
- Use heading hierarchy correctly (H2 → H3, not H2 → H4)
- Make links descriptive ("Read our case study" not "Click here")
- Ensure good color contrast

**📱 Mobile-First:**
- Most visitors are on mobile
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use images that work vertically
- Test preview on your phone

### SEO Best Practices

**For Every Post/Page:**
- [ ] Compelling title (with keywords)
- [ ] Clear, engaging excerpt/description
- [ ] Featured image with alt text
- [ ] At least 300 words of content
- [ ] 1-2 internal links to other pages
- [ ] External links open in new tabs
- [ ] Custom meta description (if different from excerpt)

**Keywords:**
- Research what your audience searches for
- Include keywords naturally in:
  - Title
  - First paragraph
  - Headings
  - Alt text
  - Meta description
- Don't stuff keywords—write for humans first

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not saving your work**
→ Click "Save" frequently (or use Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)

❌ **Forgetting alt text**
→ Every image needs it—no exceptions

❌ **Publishing before previewing**
→ Always preview first

❌ **Over-categorizing**
→ Choose 1-2 most relevant categories, not all of them

❌ **Huge image files**
→ Compress images before uploading

❌ **Vague titles**
→ Be specific and descriptive

❌ **No links**
→ Link to related content on your site

❌ **Wall of text**
→ Use headings, bullets, images to break it up
